Hi, my name is Harry and I'm from Medella Health. Did you know that last year there were 2400 new lower limb amputees in Ontario alone? Each of these patients had to go through the following cumbersome process to get their prosthetic. 

First, they have to come in for a one hour appointment to have their residual limb measured to create a plaster mold. Then they book a second appointment to test the fit of the socket, which gets sent away for manufacturing. During this time, the patient waits for 4-6 weeks for their prosthetic to be made. Once the prosthetic is made, the patient comes in to test the fit and if anything is out of place, then the entire process is repeated. 

As you can tell, this process is flawed, as it is painful, expensive and time-consuming. To solve this problem we are building sensor strips that work alongside pressure mapping software to measure stress points on the 3D printed molds. Unlike before, now the patient can test for comfort on the spot, minimize rework for the clinician and can complete the entire fitting process all in one visit. By using this process, we are focusing on the following benefits: transitioning from a messy to a clean process, improving patient comfort, and finally, optimizing the patient-clinician experience. 

Our founding team comes from the University of Waterloo. We have built 18 sensors in two years and have four patents for our technologies. Throughout this journey we have won some awesome awards and accolades, including the Thiel Fellowship, the James Dyson Award and CIX Top 20. For this project we are teaming up with one of the largest prosthetics and orthotics clinics in Ontario to pilot our technology for lower limb prosthetics. Not only does this save our healthcare providers time, but more importantly, it focuses on the quality of care for our patients. 

My name is Harry and I'm from Medella Health. Thank you.
